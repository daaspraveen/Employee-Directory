# 🗂️ Employee Directory Web Interface

A responsive and interactive employee directory built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, with data stored and managed in-browser using `localStorage`. This project simulates real-world front-end functionality without any backend or template engine.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

- 📋 **Dashboard** displaying employees:  
  ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Department, Role
- ✏️ **Edit / Delete** employee entries  
- ➕ **Add new employee** with validation
- 🔍 **Search** by name or email
- ↕️ **Sort** by First Name (A–Z) and by Department (A-Z)
- 📱 **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- ✅ **Infinite Scroll**: Loads more employees as you scroll instead of traditional pagination
- 🧠 **Validation** for required fields & email format
- 💾 **Data persistence** via `localStorage`

---

## 🚫 Not Implemented

- ❌ Filter popup UI (filtering logic ready, but no toggle button/popup yet)
- ❌ Freemarker (static implementation only)
- ❌ **Pagination** (10 / 25 / 50 / 100 entries) not implemented
